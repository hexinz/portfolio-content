		<p>
			Previously, I worked at VMware Inc. as a software engineering intern. 
			I led and went through the whole process of the intern project with a valuable deliverable that will be 
			deployed to the real company product. At the spare time, I played table tennis and billiards with my colleagues. 
			I really enjoyed the atmosphere there.
